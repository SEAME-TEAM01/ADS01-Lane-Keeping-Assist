OS:

> **Tip:**
> MacOS and Ubuntu 22 or higher version is not officialy supported by Carla. Please check system requirements in this site. [carla.readthedocs.io/en/0.9.14/start_quickstart/#before-you-begin](https://carla.readthedocs.io/en/0.9.14/start_quickstart/#before-you-begin)

# Prerequisite
- Carla (ver 0.9.14)

# Carla Installation

Please install Carla by package. Because we used 0.9.14 version, so we recommend to download with same version.

[https://github.com/carla-simulator/carla/releases/tag/0.9.14/](https://github.com/carla-simulator/carla/releases/tag/0.9.14/)

There are two ways to install Carla, first is install by    package(executable file), and the last is install from source(Unreal Engine Editor). If you want to make your own map, you must have this editor, but if not, then the unreal engine editor is too heavy (more than 100Gb) so installing only **package** is better.
