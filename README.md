# Lane Keeping Assist
> ## Introduction
> In this project, you will be exposed to the intersection of virtual simulations and real-world applications. You will delve deep into the mechanisms of the Lane Keeping Assist System (LKA), a pivotal Level 1 autonomous driving feature. Using advanced simulation platforms and actual hardware, you will design, test, and implement an LKAS that can operate both virtually and in the real world.

## ‚¨áÔ∏è Installation
Please check the document below.
> [docs/installation.md](docs/installation.md)

## ‚ùì How to use

### 1. Run the Carla Server Application.
- Linux
```Shell
./CarlaUE4.sh
```
- Windows
```Shell
./CarlaUE4.exe
```

After launch, you might can check applications look like this. You can look around the world with WASD and the mouse.

If your computer's graphic power is not enough so the application is too slow, check the command line options [here](https://carla.readthedocs.io/en/0.9.14/start_quickstart/#command-line-options). You can lower the quality by `--quality-level=Low` option.

### 2. Launch the auto-pilot.

- Move to `auto-pilot/` directory.

```Shell
# Linux / Windows
cd auto-pilot
```

- Launch the main.py application.

If you have changed some port of Carla, please let our application find that port with `--port 2004` options.

```Shell
# Linux / Windows
py -3.7 main.py
```

- ***NOW YOU SEE ME!***
