# Background Information

Autonomous Lane Detection and Lane Keeping have a rich history dating back to the early days of the automobile industry. The concept of staying within one's lane dates back to the earliest days of motoring, and rudimentary systems were developed to assist drivers in staying within the designated lanes.

However, it wasn't until the advent of computer vision and advanced control algorithms that the dream of fully autonomous lane detection and lane keeping systems became a reality. In the 1990s and early 2000s, researchers and automobile manufacturers began experimenting with computer vision and control algorithms to develop lane detection and lane keeping systems. These early systems used simple cameras and sensors to detect the road and surrounding vehicles, and basic algorithms to determine the vehicle's position and control its movements.

Over the years, significant advancements have been made in the field of autonomous vehicle technology, and lane detection and lane keeping systems have become increasingly sophisticated. Today, many automobile manufacturers offer lane detection and lane keeping systems as standard or optional features in their vehicles, and these systems are widely considered to be essential components of autonomous vehicles. With the continued growth of self-driving technology and the increasing demand for skilled professionals in the field, the development of autonomous lane detection and lane keeping systems will play a critical role in shaping the future of the automotive industry.

The PiRacer project is a peer-to-peer educational initiative aimed at introducing students and hobbyists to the exciting world of autonomous vehicles and their underlying technology, including autonomous lane detection and lane keeping.
