> "Autonomous Lane Detection with PiRacer: A Hands-On Approach to Self-Driving Vehicles" is a peer-to-peer educational project aimed at introducing students and hobbyists to the exciting world of autonomous vehicles. The project focuses on using the Raspberry Pi and various sensors and actuators to build a low-cost yet powerful autonomous vehicle. The goal of the project is to demonstrate how a simple computer like the Raspberry Pi can be used to develop an autonomous vehicle that can detect lanes and maintain its position within them. With a hands-on approach, participants will learn about the fundamentals of autonomous vehicles and gain practical experience in building one themselves. Join us on this journey to discover the future of self-driving technology.

## :calendar: Project Plans
(generated by chatGPT)
#### 1. Project Initialization:
- **Understanding the Scope**:
  Familiarize yourself with the goals and objectives.
  This helps in aligning every activity towards the project's end goals.
- **Stakeholder Meeting**:
  Conduct an initial meeting with stakeholders, educators, or students to ensure everyone's expectations are aligned.
#### 2. Hardware Setup:
- **Inventory Check**:
  Ensure all necessary hardware components like Raspberry Pi, sensors, actuators, and the power supply are available.
  Assembly: Assemble the vehicle. This includes attaching the Raspberry Pi, sensors, actuators, and setting up the power supply.
  Ensure the physical integrity of the vehicle.
#### 3. Software Environment Setup:
- **Raspberry Pi Setup**:
  Install a suitable OS (like Raspbian) and ensure network connectivity.
- **Development Environment**:
  Set up a development environment with necessary tools like compilers, text editors, etc.
- **Install Libraries**:
  Install OpenCV for image processing, TensorFlow for machine learning, PiCamera for camera interface, Adafruit Libraries for sensor control, and other necessary libraries.
ROS Setup (Optional): If you're using ROS, set up the environment and familiarize yourself with its components.
#### 4. Data Acquisition & Image Processing:
- **Sensor Data Collection**:
  Write code to gather data from the vehicle's sensors. Test and validate the data integrity.
- **Image Processing Algorithms**:
  Implement image processing algorithms using OpenCV. Focus on edge detection, thresholding, and feature extraction for lane detection.
#### 5. Decision Making & Control:
- **Neural Network Training**:
  If using TensorFlow, set up a neural network model. Train the model with appropriate datasets to recognize lanes and decide direction/speed.
- **Control Logic**:
  Implement the control logic. Based on the decisions, write code to control the actuators (like steering servos and motors).
#### 6. User Interface & Networking:
- **UI Development**:
  Develop the user interface. This can be a dashboard to monitor and control the PiRacer.
- **Network Connectivity**:
  Ensure the Raspberry Pi has connectivity for remote monitoring/control. Implement necessary networking code.
#### 7. Testing:
- **Module Testing**:
  Test individual components like image processing, decision-making, and control.
  Integrated Testing: Once individual tests are successful, test the integrated system.
- **Field Testing**:
  Deploy the vehicle in a controlled environment to see how it performs in real-world scenarios.
#### 8. Debugging & Documentation:
- **Debugging**:
  Continuously debug throughout the development. Use logs to understand unexpected behaviors.
- **Documentation**:
  Document the setup process, code, and user instructions. This is crucial for educational projects.
#### 9. Community Building & Support:
- **Online Forum**:
  Establish an online platform for participants to share experiences, ask questions, and help each other.
- **Regular Workshops**:
  Organize workshops or webinars to onboard new enthusiasts and provide advanced tutorials.
#### 10. Future Enhancements & Closure:
- **Feedback Collection**:
  Collect feedback from users and participants. Understand what went well and what areas need improvement.
- **Scope for Future**:
  Based on feedback, understand potential enhancements or new features.
- **Project Closure**:
  Document all achievements, learnings, and handover any necessary resources or controls to stakeholders.
- **References**:
  Utilize the provided references like OpenCV, TensorFlow, ROS, and PiCamera for specific modules.
This structured plan will ensure a systematic approach to the project while ensuring that each component is given its due importance.
